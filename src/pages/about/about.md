I descend from a family of educators, social impact activists, and entrepreneurs. From a young age, I enjoyed joining my father within his community impact work and had a natural curiosity which I expressed towards music, gaming, and technology. Although I still love creating music and gaming with my friends, I have focused that same curiosity towards engineering and social impact through my father’s and my company, Human Impact Productions (SBGD/HIP Enterprise), and our STEAM Labs Programs. I am fascinated by bringing complex ideas to life, working with others, and sharing my experience with the younger generations.

In 2025, I will be graduating with my BS in Software Engineering, providing leadership assistance with our company’s growth, and preparing for graduate school in Systems Engineering beginning in 2026. 

As previously mentioned, I was heavily involved in music during my childhood. I have been playing in bands since I was 9 years old, and since my dad was active in the philanthropy scene of Tucson, I was always either helping him produce events for non-profits or performing at those events. By the time I was 16, I had volunteered at over 60 events throughout the southwest. This experience earned me the Outstanding Youth in Philanthropy award given by the Associate of Fundraising Professionals in 2018. Simultaneously, I was inducted to the Tucson’s Musicians Museum Hall and Fame as the Up and Coming Musician of the year. I followed this momentum into the Summer of 2019, in which I co-founded and produced the Tribal Nations Music Tour (now known as the SBGD/HIP Enterprise Tribal Nations Reach Productions) bringing entertainment and STEAM Labs development to under-discovered indigenous communities. As of now, I have produced over 300 social impact events and plan to do many more!

In the last 5 years, I have explored the STEM economic and employment opportunities within the entertainment and sports industries, researching and attending conferences relating to the music sync industry, music/sound production, and live audio/video systems.
